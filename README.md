## Motivation and Problem Satement

Stress claims **120k lives/year** and is primarily caused by lack of fun physical activities. 

### What we have
Pandemic locked us with mainly videogames for stressbuster. While these games may temporarily make us stress-free, the **fun** physical component is completely overlooked hence partially solving the problem.

At the same time, simple exercising equipment at homes or gyms give a monotonous feel and eventually the user gets bored and stops this form of exercise.

Gaming consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, Wii tried including a physical component for games but failed because the gamers' involvement is limited as compared to that of PC based Shooting games or Racing games or Role playing games.
 
### What we need
We need a setup which can provide the level of involvement and familiarity that PC games offer and the exercise that gyms offer while maximizing diversity of games and minimizing cost.

## Solution: νβike??

**νβike** is a compact desk bike based gaming peripheral which connects with the gaming device directly. 

I designed an algorithm to directly map the movements made by the bike to the gaming controls while maintaining low latency.

I played my favorite games - CS:GO, Need For Speed MW, and GTA which cover different classes of games using νβike.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

### It works!

My resting heart rate is 58 bpm. When I take long runs, my heart rate reaches around 145bpm - Zone 2. I had used the desk bike earlier without any modifications, I never managed to get my heart rate above 120 bpm. I usually got bored after 5-10 minutes of it, same happened with gym equipment. 

**Surprise!!**
I played games using νβike and to my surprise, I played for around 2 hours, heart rate around 150bpm, and I loved it!!  

**Inclusion of all age groups**
My mother, who is 53, played comfortably with it. It helps strengthening her Quad muscles, knee joints at an easy pace. She enjoyed exercising while gaming greatly! 

**Assisting my obese buddies**

Apart from the current pandemic, the pandemic of obesity is well known around the world and especially in USA. They are game junkies, engrossed in their little world, depriving themselves of exercise and making themselves vulnerable to Mental and Physical Disorders. 

I sent a video to them, they loved it and wanted it immediately! This would help them reduce weight and decrease heart rate and blood pressure. This would make them emotionally and mentally happy in their life.

**Not to forget, the competition!**

Gamers improve their skills by competing with fellow gamers worldwide. 
This would soon apply to health as well! All thanks to νβike.

I can't wait to give these to my cousins and race with them or shoot around with them or steal some cars! {Of course I am talking about the game!}
