## Motivation and Problem Satement

Stress claims **120k lives/year** and is primarily caused by lack of fun physical activities. 

### What we have
Pandemic locked us with mainly videogames for stressbuster. While these games may temporarily make us stress-free, the **fun** physical component is completely overlooked hence partially solving the problem.

At the same time, simple exercising equipment at homes or gyms give a monotonous feel and eventually the user gets bored and stops this form of exercise.

Gaming consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, Wii tried including a physical component for games but failed because the gamers' involvement is limited as compared to that of PC based Shooting games or Racing games or Role playing games.
 
### What we need
We need a setup which can provide the level of involvement and familiarity that PC games offer and the exercise that gyms offer while maximizing diversity of games and minimizing cost.

## Solution: νβike??

**νβike** is a compact desk bike based gaming peripheral which connects with the gaming device directly.

I played my favorite games - CS:GO, Need For Speed MW, and GTA which cover different classes of games using νβike.
